# PygClar

This is a very basic framework for a game/game engine made in Python and Pyglet. You can move around, place objects, and really not much else.
I'm an amateur to say the least, so I make no guarantees of quality. Most of this was cobbled together via documentation and small code examples.
I find that Pyglet is very difficult to learn, in part due to a lack of usage. Tutorials were almost all focused on basics, or were just never finished.

I hope someone can find some use for it.

# Requirements
It requires Python 3 and Pyglet 1.3.2
